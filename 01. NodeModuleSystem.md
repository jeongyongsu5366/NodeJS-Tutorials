### Global Object

```javascript
console.log() 
//Global Object and it is a part of global scope, which means we can access it anywherem in any files.

// For example,

setTimeout();
clearTimeout();

setInterval(); // repeately call a function after a given delay.
clearInterval();

window; // this will represent a global scope
window.console.log();
// JS engine will prefix this statement with window.console.log() because that is where this function is defined.

var message = '';
window.message

// In Node, we use global instead of window
global.setTimeout

global.console.log(global.message); // undefined
// the variables and functions that we defined are not added to the glo bal object. They are only a scope to this file app.js. So they are not available outside of this file.
// This is because of Node's modular system.
```

### Module

```javascript
// When we declare a variable or a function, that is added to the global scope. For example,
var sayHello = function() {
    
}

window.sayHello();
```

- There is a problem with this behavior. In a real world application, we often split our JS code into multiple files. So, it is possible that we have two files and in both those files we define this function sayHello with the exact same name. Because this function is added to the global scope, when we define this function in another file, that new definition is going to override the previous definition. So, this is the problem with the global scope.

-  In order to build reliable and maintainable applications, we should avoid defining variables and functions in the global scope. Instead, we need modularity.

-  We need to create small building blocks or modules where we define our variables and functions. So two variables and functions with the same name don't override a variable or function defined someone else. They are encapsulated inside of that module.

- At the core of Node, we have this concept called Module. Every file in a Node application is considered a Module. The variables and functions defined in that function or modules are a scope to that file. 

- In OOP terms we say they are private, they are not available outside that container or that module. If you want to use a variable or a function in a module, outside that module, you need to explicitly export it and make it public.

- Every Node Application has at least one file or one module which we call the main module. In this case our app.js is our main module.

```javascript
//app.js

//console.log(global.module);
// You may think we can access it via the global object. But actually this is not global object even though it appears to be global.

console.log(module);
```

### Creating a Module

```javascript
// logger.js
var url = 'http://mylogger.io/log';

// both url and log function are scoped to this module. They're private and not visible from the outside.
function log(message) {
    // Send an HTTP request
    // To keep thigs simple here, we just want to focus on the modularity, 		we don't want to get distracted with all the details of sending http 		request
    console.log(message);
}

module.exports.log = log;

// Object that we're exporting here has a single method called log. Now similarly, if you want to export this URL,

//module.exports.url = url;
module.exports.endPoint = url;

// We don't need to export this url variable because this is purely implementation detail. In a real world application, every module might have several variables and functions. We only want to export a subset of these members to the outside because we want to keep this module easy to use.

// Think of a DVD player - A DVD player has a few buttons on the outside, and these are the buttons or objects that we interact with. So these objects represet the public interface of a DVD player. But inside the box there are lots of other objects that are complex object, we don't need to know anything about these objects, such as main-board, because they are implementation detail.

// What we see from outside is stable or static across different models.
// In our logger module, our url is implementation detail, therefore, other modules don't need to know anything about this, they only need to call log function.

// So we export these, make it public, but keep the URL private
// module.exports.endPoint = url;

```

```javascript
// app.js
console.log(module)
```

- which is our main module, we want to use this logger module. We should be able to access this log function and call it from the app module. In other words, we need to make this public. we make to make it visible from the outside

### Loading a Module

```javascript
//app.js
// var logger = require('./logger.js');
// this require function will return the object that is exported from this target module.
const logger = 'http://mylogger.io/log';
// renameing it
const log = 'http://mylogger.io/log';
// because we don't want to accidentally overwrite the value of logger like this.
logger = 1;


logger.log('message');
```

```javascript
// logger.js
// var url = 'http://mylogger.io/log';
// it is better to store the result in a constant

function log(message) {

    console.log(message);
}

module.exports.log = log;

// Instead of exporting an object, we can export a single function.

module.exports = log;
// logger is no longer an object, it is a function that we can call directly

// we don't need to write down like this logger.log,
// instead, we can use it like logger('message');
```

```javascript
// We can scan all our JS code for errors
$jshint app.js
```

### Module Wrapper Function

- The variables and functions we defined in a module are scoped to that module. They are private and not visible from the outside. 
- How Node does this?

```javascript
var x =;
// If var x=; is at the second line, it doesn't work.
var url = 'http://mylogger.io/log';

function log(message) {
    console.log(message);
}

module.exports = log;
```

- Node does not execute this code directly. It wraps it inside of a function. 
- Our code is going to be converted to something like this.

```javascript
// We have this function declaration.
// This is an immediately involved function expression or 
(function (exports, require, module, __filename, __dirname) {
    
    console.log(__filename);
    console.log(__dirname);
    
	var x = ;
	var url = 'http://mylogger.io/log';

	function log(message) {
		console.log(message)        
	}

	module.exports = log;
 
});

```

- Node does not execute our code directly. It always wraps the code inside each module, in something like this, inside of a function.
- Look at these arguments to this function, so, you have seen the require function. I have told you that this require function appears to be global, but actually it's not global, in fact, it is local to each module. So, every module requires one of the arguments that is passed to this function.
- We call this function (the above immediately invoked function) 
- **"Module Wrapper Function"** 

```javascript
// __filename
// __dirname
// these represents the name of this file and the path.
console.log(__filename);
console.log(__dirname); 
// the path to the directory that contains that module

var x = ;
var url = 'https://mylogger.io/log';

function log(message) {
	console.log(message);
}

module.exports = log;
```

### Path Module

```javascript
// https://nodejs.org/en/
Docs --> v8.9.3 API 
File System, HTTP, OS, Path, Process, Query Strings, Stream, 
```

```javascript
//Path Module
// Parse
const path = require('path'); 
// Node assumes that this is a built-in path module.

var pathObj = path.parse(__filename); // which is one the arguments in the module wrapper function

console.log(pathObj);
```

### OS Module

```javascript
// OS Module
// os.freemem(); which returns the amount of free memory
// os.totalmem();

const os = require('os');

var totalMemory = os.totalmem();
var freeMemory = os.freemem();

console.log('Total Memory: ' + totalMemory);

// Template String
// ES6 / ES2015: ECMAScript 6
console.log(`Total Memory: ${totalMemory}`);
console.log(`Free Memory: ${freeMemory}`);

// When using Node, JS code is executed outside of a brower or on the server.
```

### File System Module

```javascript
const fs = require('fs');

// Always use async methods

const files = fs.readdirSync('./');
// this will return all the files and folders in the current folder

console.log(files);

// './' changes to $ will be error
fs.readdir('./', function(err, files) {
    if(err) {
        console.log('Error', err);
    }
    else {
        console.log('Result', files);
    }
});
// all these async methods take a function as their last argument. Node will call this function when that asynchronous operation completes. We call this function a call-back
```

### Events Module

- Lots of Node's core functionality is based on this concept of events.
- **An event is basically a signal that indicates that something has happened**.
- For example, In Node, we have a class called http that we can use to build a web server. So we listen on a given port, and every time we receive a request on that port, that http class raises an event. Now our job is to respond to that event which basically involves reading that request and returning the right response.

```javascript
// We have one class that is called "EventEmitter".
// It is one of the core building blocks of Node, and a lot of classes are based on this EventEmitter.

const EventEmitter = require('events');
// The first letter is uppercase which is a convention that indicates that this eventEmitter is a class. It's not a function, it's not a simple, but it's a class.

// This class is container for properties and functions which we call methods.
```

```javascript
const EventEmitter = require('events');
// In order to use EventEmitter, we need to create an instance of this class
const emitter = new EventEmitter(); // actual object
// class is like a human and object is like an actual person like John

emitter.emit('messageLogged'); // pass name of the event
// to raise an event
// emit basically means "making a noise, produce somethig."
// In this case, you're making a noise in our application, you're signaling event has happened
```

```javascript
const EventEmitter = require('events');
const emitter = new EventEmitter();

//Register a Listener
emitter.on('messageLogged', function() {
	console.log('Listener called')
});

//Raise an event
emitter.emit('messageLogged')

// Of course, the order is important, if the listener after calling the emit method, nothing would have happenend because when we call the emit method, this emitter iterates over all the registered listeners and calls tehm synchronous.
```

### Event Arguments

```javascript
const EventEmitter = require('events');
const emitter = new EventEmitter();

//Register a Listener
emitter.on('messageLogged', function(arg) { //e or eventArg
	console.log('Listener called', arg);
});

//Raise an event
// emitter.emit('messageLogged', 1, 'url'); 
//add event arguments
// when you send multiple values about an event, you had better encapsulate these values inside an object.

emitter.emit('messageLogged', {id: 1, url: 'http://'})
// we can pass data about the event that just happened
```

```javascript
//app.js
const EventEmitter = require('events');
const emitter = new EventEmitter();

// Register a Listener
// we can get rid of this function keyword
emitter.on('messageLogged', (arg) => { //e or eventArg
	console.log('Listener called', arg);
});

// Raise an event
emitter.emit('messageLogged', {id: 1, url: 'http://'})

// Raise: logging (data: message)


```

- You want to create a class that has all the capabilities of the EventEmitter.

```javascript
//logger.js
const EventEmitter = require('events');
const emitter = new EventEmitter(); // this is an object

var url = 'http://mylogger.io/log';

function log(message) {
    // Send an HTTP request
    console.log(message);
    emitter.emit('messageLogged', {id: 1, url: 'http://'})
}

module.exports = log;
```

```javascript
//app.js
const EventEmitter = require('events');
const emitter = new EventEmitter(); // this is an object

// Register a Listener
// we can get rid of this function keyword
emitter.on('messageLogged', (arg) => { //e or eventArg
	console.log('Listener called', arg);
});
// the eventlistener was not called. The reason for this is because here we are working with two different EventEmitter in both app.js and logger.js

const log = require('./logger');
log('message');

```

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

```javascript
// logger.js
const EventEmitter = require('events');
//const emitter = new EventEmitter(); // this is an object

var url = 'http://mylogger.io/log';
// this logger class has all the functionality that is defined in EventEmitter

class Logger extends EventEmitter {
	log(message) {
    // Send an HTTP request
    console.log(message);
        
    // Raise an event    
    this.emit('messageLogged', {id: 1, url: 'http://'})
//  emitter.emit('messageLogged', {id: 1, url: 'http://'})

	}
}

module.exports = Logger;

// - If you want to raise events in your application to signal that something has happened, you need to create a class that extends EventEmitter. With this, that class will have all the functionality defined in EventEmitter. But you can also add additional functionality.
// - In this case we have the ability to log a message, and then inside that class whenever you want to raise an event you use this.emit because this references this logger class itself, which extends EventEmitter
```

```javascript
// app.js
const EventEmitter = require('events');

const Logger = require('./logger');
const logger = new Logger();

logger.on("messageLogged", (arg) => {
   console.log('Listener called', arg); 
});
// hey logger when you raise this message log event, I want to execute this code.

logger.log('message');

```

### HTTP Module

- One of the powerful building blocks of Node is the http module that we use for creating networking applications. For example, we can create a web server that listens for http requests on a given port. With this we can easily create a backend service for our client applications. Like a web application that we build with react or angular or a mobile application on a mobile device.

```javascript
const http = require('http');
// http.Server: this class inherits from net.Server and has the following additional events;

const server = http.createServer();
// this server is an EventEmitter, so it has all the capabilities of EventEmitter.
server.listen(3000);
//server.on or emit or lister 
```

```javascript
const http = require('http');

const server = http.createServer();
server.on('connection', (socket) => {
    console.log('New Connection...')
});

server.listen(3000);

console.log('Listening on port 3000')

// we don't use like this in a real application because it is very low level
```

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

```javascript
const http = require('http');

const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
    if(req.url === '/') {
        res.write('Hello World');
        res.end();
    }
    // Now if you want to build a backend service or web or mobile 		   		applications, we need to handle various routes here
    
    if(req.url === '/api/courses') {
        res.write(JSON.stringify([1, 2, 3]));
        res.end();
    }
    
});


server.listen(3000);

console.log('Listening on port 3000')

//localhost:3000/api/courses
```

### Summary

- We don't have the window object in Node.

- The global object in Node is "global".

- Unlike browser applications, variables we define are not added to the "global" object

- Every file in a Node application is a module. Node automatically wraps the code in each file with an IIFE (Immediately-invoked-Function-Expression) to create scope. So, variables and functions defined in one file are only scoped to that file are not visible to other files unless explicitly exported.

- To export a variable or function from a module, you need to add them to module.exports: module.exports.sayHello = sayHello;

- To load a module, use the require function. This function returns the module.exports object exported from the target module: 

  - const logger = require('./logger');

- Node has a few built-in modules that enable us to work with the file system, path objects, network, operating system, etc.

- EventEmitter is one of the core classes in Node that allows us to raise (emit) and handle events. Several built-in classes in Node derive from EventEmitter.

- To create a class with the ability to raise events, we should extend EventEmitter: 

  - class Logger extends EventEmitter {

    

    }
